""" Sarah, a programming instructor, is preparing a teaching demonstration on recursive algorithms for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two integers. She requires a program that demonstrates the recursive approach to finding the LCM of two given integers.



Your task is to assist Sarah in developing a program that calculates the LCM of two integers using recursion.

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated integers, a and b.

Output format :
The output prints a single integer representing the LCM of a and b.

""'


def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)

def cal_lcm(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return cal_lcm(b, a % b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    gcd_result = gcd(a, b)
    lcm_result = (a * b) // gcd_result

    print(lcm_result)
